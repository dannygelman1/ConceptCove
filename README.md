## Inspiration

Being a hobbyist 3D Artist, I will often go down a rabbit hole searching through concept art on [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/channels/environmental_concept_design?sort_by=trending&dimension=all) to inspire my next work. I will have many tabs open, save many png's in folders and subfolders, and it would become one big mess. I decided to create a webapplication where I can store my concept art neatly and all in one place.
